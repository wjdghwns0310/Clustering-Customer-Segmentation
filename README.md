You can also see here the full description of the project and related datasets.

## Introduction
Olist, a sales solution for online markeplaces wants to develop a customer segmentation that its marketing teams can use on a routine basis for their communication campaigns. 
Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. 
Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners
After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. 
Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.

## Goals
1. Olist marketing teams need an actionable description of the segmentation that allows them to thoroughly grasp its underlying logic .
2. The quality of the data is somewhat poor. The idea is to create the best possible features for making optimum use of them, like Recency, Frequency and Monatary variables
3. The segmentation needs to be robust: adding a few new customers to the database and creating a new segmentation using the same model should not result in totally different conclusions
